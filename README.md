| Room          | Possible Threat | Items Found                      |

| Car           | Snake           | Map, Phone, Gas Bottle           |
| Swamp         | Crocodile       | Fishing Net, Fish, Emergency Kit |

## 🛡 Weapons Shop

If you encounter a monster, you can fight using weapons:

| Code | Weapon             | Price | Effect                    |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | Stun Gun           | $30   | Stuns monster temporarily |
| 2    | Sword              | $100  | Kills monster permanently |
| 3    | Invisibility Cloak | $40   | Avoids monster twice      |

If you run out of both **money and weapons**, it's **Game Over** ☠️.
